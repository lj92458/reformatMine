# reformatMine

<!-- Plugin description -->
**reformatMine** is a jetbrain plugin to reformat only selected area (not whole file),which is useful to keep old code as it is.
if you haven't selected an area, it will do nothing. Some leaders asked their team not to reformat the old code,so this
plugin is useful to prevent you from making mistakes.   
####Our default keymap is [ctrl+alt+/],but we suggest you to set [ctrl+alt+L] to this plugin,so this plugin can instead the original one.
